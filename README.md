What I Learned from the Project on Dimensionality Reduction using Autoencoders
In this project, I gained hands-on experience with dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically using autoencoders. Here are the key takeaways:

Data Preprocessing and Scaling: I learned how to preprocess and scale data using the MinMaxScaler from sklearn to ensure all features are on the same scale before feeding them into the autoencoder.

Building and Training Autoencoders: I developed a sequential model in Keras for the autoencoder, which included an input layer, a bottleneck (hidden) layer, and an output layer. The model was trained to reconstruct the input data, allowing me to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

Visualization of Reduced Dimensions: By extracting the output from the hidden layer, I visualized the data in a reduced 2-dimensional space using Seaborn's scatterplot. This helped me understand how the autoencoder can separate different classes even with reduced dimensions.

Model Evaluation: Through the training process, I monitored the loss and accuracy, learning how these metrics can indicate the model's performance. This helped me ensure the model was learning the data representation effectively.

This project has significantly improved my understanding of dimensionality reduction, autoencoders, and data visualization techniques, equipping me with valuable skills for handling high-dimensional data in real-world applications.
